      "A scientist named Fave Doster is investigating the relationship between weight-lifting and programming. He has gathered 3 datasets. Each dataset contains measurements of the sum of the single repetition maximum lifted weight for three exercises. We will call that sum \"strength\" for short. Dataset 1 is the strength of people who use steriods and take regular protein and creatine supplements. Dataset 2 is the strength of people who do not use supplements and do not program. Dataset 3 is the same people as dataset 2 after taking CHE 116 and learning python. Fave Doster's hypothesis is that if you program in python, you won't be as strong as those who use steriods, creatine and protein supplements. Is Fave Doster's hypothesis correct? Use two different hypothesis tests to provide evidence for or against. The data is below."
